    <section class="course">
        <h1>Courses We Offer</h1>
        <p>Eduford offers more than 350 graduate courses across the disciplines, with courses opening in new areas every
            year. This includes taught courses and research courses available for full-time and part-time study, and at
            every level from diplomas to doctorates.</p>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Indermediate</h3>
                <p>A good intermediate college is a bridge between a school and a graduate college. The two-year time is
                    so crucial that many either make or break their careers. The best intermediate colleges have their
                    focus more on the conceptual education and on building the character of the students rather than
                    just grinding them for upcoming exams.Only a few can profit from constant grinding. Ranks matter to
                    colleges! When we consider the long term benefits of the conceptual education, we see that students
                    would excel not only in the board exams, they would also excel in the entrance exams.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Degree</h3>
                <p> A degree can help you score better job opportunities, which will not only improve your life, but
                    will also financially affect the people around you.Whether you want to start in marketing, web
                    design, or any high-paying job for that matter, a degree can improve your earning and employment
                    potential. There is even evidential proof to support this argument. Apart from the studies and
                    research, acquiring a degree is extremely beneficial for individuals who want to have a defined and
                    high-paying career path ahead of them. </p>

                <h3>Post Graduation</h3>
                <p>There was a time when completing graduation meant a lot. It has been considered as reaching one of
                    the most significant milestones. However, time started changing rapidly, the importance of
                    graduation didn’t vanish, but the importance of post-graduation rose.Getting jobs for graduates
                    became difficult; as the competition in the market increased. It was an urge in the market to hire
                    upskilled and knowledgeable candidates—the reason why the demand for post-graduation surged.</p>

                    <p>I am satisfied and feeling good to study in this college.The infrastructure is good. The campus
                        is very clean with a pleasant atmosphere. Coming to the labs, the equipment is pretty good as we
                        have seen in the books. There are a lot of books in the library, and they buying new editions
                        every year continuously. But the hostel food is not good as well. The hostel is a kilometer
                        distance from the college and we can go to the college on a walk.</p>
